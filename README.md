There is a login page, a forgot password page and a register page. I used this template for the login pages, http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/custom-login-registration-amp-forgot-password
They have a js section in case you want to check it out.

To use the application, take the rre.sql file and add it to your phpmyadmin because it is the required maridb/mysql database for this website.

Sample user information-
username: admin   password:adminadmin
This username can be used to view the admin pages and the submitter pages.
You can alternatively register to view the submitter pages.
