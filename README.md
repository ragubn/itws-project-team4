Update 11.21
Hey guys,

So far in terms of html, I have two menu pages, home and research. Home has three sections; welcome, innovations and highlights.Research has a search bar and links to different categories of research at rpi. 

There is a login page, a forgot password page and a register page. I used this template for the login pages, http://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/custom-login-registration-amp-forgot-password
They have a js section in case you want to check it out.
