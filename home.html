    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>Research is an essential part of a university, and a valuable educational experience. By placing the research that an institution is currently partaking in on a central website, it allows students to see the opportunities that exist for them to get involved on campus. As well, it provides the ability for students who are taking part in research the ability to let others know what they are doing and see what other students are researching.</p>
